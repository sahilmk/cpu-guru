            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The 4004, manufactured from 1971 to 1981, was the first commercially available processor as well as the first complete CPU on a single chip. The chip was packaged in a 16-pin ceramic dual in-line package and was initially released with a clock speed of 108 KHz (and scaled up to 740 KHz). Produced in a 10 μm (10,000 nm) process, the 4004 had 2,300 transistors and delivered a performance of 0.07 MIPS.
                <br class="hidden lg:inline-block"><br>The 8-bit 8008 replaced the 4004 in 1972 with 0.5 to 0.8 MHz clock speed and 3,500 transistors, and was primarily used in the TI 742 computer. The 8080 followed in 1974 with 4,500 transistors in 6,000 nm with up to 2 MHz and became famous for being used in the Altair 8800 as well as in Boeing's AGM-86 cruise missile.
                <br><br>None of these chips were sold in considerable volumes.

Introduced on June 1, 1979, the 8088 has an eight-bit external data bus instead of the 16-bit bus of the 8086. The 16-bit registers and the one megabyte address range are unchanged, however. In fact, according to the Intel documentation, the 8086 and 8088 have the same execution unit (EU)—only the bus interface unit (BIU) is different. The original IBM PC is based on the 8088, as are its clones. The Wang PC from Wang Laboratories uses the Intel 8086. The IBM 5150, the first PC, came with the 8088 (5-8MHz).</p>

                <br><br>Introduced in 1981, the 432 was Intel's first 32-bit design – an amazingly complex design for its time that integrated hardware-based multitasking and memory management features. Designed for high-end systems, the downfall of the 4-8 MHz 432 was the fact that it was much more expensive to produce and slower than the emerging 80286 design.
                <br><br>While the 432 was originally designed as a replacement for the 8086 series, the project was ended in 1982.</p>

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The 32-bit era began with the release of the 386DX CPU in 1985. With 275,000 transistors (1,500 nm) and clock speeds ranging from 16 to 33 MHz, the CPU hit up to 11.4 MIPS.In 1988, Intel followed up with the 1,000 nm 386SX, which had a narrower 16-bit bus to target mobile and low-cost desktop computing systems. Although the 386SX remained fully 32-bit capable internally, the data bus was cut down to 16 bits to simplify circuit board layout and reduce costs. Additionally, although not critical at the time, only 24 pins were connected to the 386SX's address bus, which effectively limited it to addressing 16MB of memory.
                <br><br>Both of the chips lacked a math coprocessor, and due to early problems with the i387 coprocessor not being production-ready in time for the 80386, both chips had to fall back to the 80287 as their math coprocessor until the 80387 was released to the market.Intel's first notebook chip, the 386SL, arrived in 1990 as a highly integrated design with on-chip cache, bus, and memory controller. The processor had 855,000 transistors and ran between 20 and 25 MHz.Despite it becoming obsolete as a personal computer CPU in the early '90s, Intel continued to manufacture the 80386 family until September of 2007, due to market demand for the chip to be used in embedded systems and the chip's wide use by the aerospace industry.

The 1,000 nm and 800 nm design was launched as 486DX with 25 to 50 MHz, included 1.2 million transistors and delivered 41 MIPS. The low-end 486SX (a 486DX with disabled math co-processor) followed in 1991 with 16 to 33 MHz.
                <br><br>In 1992, Intel introduced an update as the 486DX2 (SX2) with up to 66 MHz, while the 486SL as an enhanced 486SX was offered for notebooks (up to 33 MHz, 800 nm, 1.4 million transistors). The final stage of the 486 series was the 486DX4 with up to 100 MHz, which was marketed as an economical solution for those who did not want to spend more money on the new Pentium systems. The DX4 was built in a 600 nm process, had 1.6 million transistors and was rated at 70.7 MIPS.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Pentium is a brand used for a series of x86 architecture-compatible microprocessors produced by Intel since 1993. In their form as of November 2011, Pentium processors are considered entry-level products that Intel rates as "two stars",[1] meaning that they are above the low-end Atom and Celeron series, but below the faster Intel Core lineup, and workstation Xeon series.
            <br><br>The P5 Pentium launched with 60 MHz in 1993 and was available with up to 200 MHz (P54CS) in 1996. The original 800 nm design had 3.1 million transistors, but scaled to 3.3 million in the 350 nm 1996 design. The P55C was announced in 1997 with MMX (Multimedia Extensions) and expanded the processor design to 4.5 million transistors and 233 MHz clock speed. The mobile version of the Pentium MMX remained available until 1999 and reached 300 MHz.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Upon its release, the Pentium Pro was a largely misunderstood processor. Many believed that the Pro was intended to replace the P5. However, as a precursor to the Pentium II Xeon, the Pentium Pro was tailored to deal with workloads typical for servers and workstations.
            <br><br>Other than what the name implies, the Pentium Pro's architecture was different from the regular Pentiums and supported out of order execution, for example. In addition to the different architecture, the Pentium Pro had a 36-bit address bus, which supported up to 64GB of memory. The Pentium Pro was built in 350 nm, had 5.5 million transistors, and came in several variants with clock speeds ranging from 150 and 200 MHz. Its most famous application was the integration in the ASCI Red supercomputer, which was first to break through the 1 TFLOPS performance barrier.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Pentium II was a consumer-focused processor developed on top of the sixth-generation P6 architecture, and the first Intel CPU that was delivered in a cartridge-like slot module and not a socket device. The Pentium II had 2 million more transistors (7.5 million) than the P6, significantly improving 16-bit execution, which was a problem in the initial P6 release, and carried on the MMX instruction set that was introduced with the Pentium.
            <br><br>The Pentium II was released with the 350 nm Klamath core (233 and 266 MHz). Deschutes arrived as a shrink to 250 nm and clock speeds up to 450 nm in 1998, and was also offered as Pentium II Overdrive as an upgrade option for the Pentium Pro. Mobile Pentium II processors got the 250 nm Tonga and 250 nm and 250nm/180 nm Dixon cores.

While Celerons are based on the company's current processor technology, they usually come with substantial downgrades, such as less cache memory, which positions them as processors that are just "good enough" for the most basic PC applications and allows Intel to compete at the very bottom of the PC market.
            <br><br>The first Celeron series was based on the 250 nm Covington core for desktops and the 250 nm Mendocino core (19 million transistors, including L2 on-die cache) for notebooks. The processors were available from 266 to 300 MHz on the desktop and up to 500 MHz on the mobile side, and were updated well into the days of the succeeding Pentium III. Today's Celerons are based on Sandy Bridge architecture.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Pentium III was released in 1999 and was Intel's initial contender in the gigahertz race with AMD as well as the CPU that countered the low-power challenge from Transmeta in early 2000. The chip was initially released with the 250 nm Katmai core and was quickly scaled down to 180 nm with Coppermine, Coppermine T and to 130 nm with the Tualatin core. The transistor count jumped from 9.5 million in Katmai to 28.1 million in the following cores due to the integrated L2 cache. The initial clock speed was 450 MHz and eventually reached 1,400 MHz with Tualatin. Intel was criticized to have rushed out the first gigahertz versions to compete with AMD's Athlon, which forced the company to recall its gigahertz processors and re-release them at a later time.
            <br><br>Also noteworthy on the consumer side was the announcement of the Mobile Pentium III in 2000, which introduced SpeedStep and a scaling ability of clock speed of the processor, depending on its operation mode. The Mobile Pentium III was announced one day before the announcement of the Transmeta Crusoe processor, and many still believe that the Mobile Pentium III would not have been released without the pressure of Transmeta, which was famous for employing Linux inventor Linus Torvalds.

            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Pentium 4 arguably took Intel on a path that led to the most dramatic transformation of Intel in the company's history. Launched in 2000 with the 180 nm Willamette core (42 million transistors), the chip's Netburst architecture was designed to scale with clock speed, and Intel envisioned that the foundation would allow the company to hit frequencies of more than 20 GHz by 2010. Netburst, however, was more limited than initially thought, and by 2003, Intel knew that the current leakage and power consumption was increasing with higher clock speeds too fast. Netburst launched with 1.3 and 1.4 GHz, increased to 2.2 GHz with the 130 nm Northwood core (55 million transistors) in 2002, and to 3.8 GHz with the 90 nm Prescott core (125 million transistors) in 2005. Intel also launched the first Extreme Edition processors with the Gallatin core in 2003.
                <br><br>Over time, the Pentium 4 series became increasingly confusing, with Mobile Pentium 4-M processors, Pentium 4E HT (hyperthreading) processors with support for a virtual second core, and Pentium 4F processors with the 65 nm Cedar Mill core (Pentium 4 600 series) in 2005. Intel planned to replace the Pentium 4 family with the Tejas processor, but canceled the project when it was clear that Netburst would not be able to reach clock speeds beyond 3.8 GHz. Core, the following architecture, was a dramatic turnaround to much more efficient CPUs with a strict power ceiling that put Intel's gigahertz machine in reverse.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The first Xeon that did not bring the Pentium brand along was based on Pentium 4's Netburst architecture and debuted with the 180 nm Foster core. It was available with 1.4 to 2.0 GHz clock speeds. The Netburst architecture continued until 2006, when Intel had expanded Xeon to a full line of UP and MP processors with the 90 nm Nocona, Irwindale, Cranford, Potomac and Paxville cores and the 65 nm Dempsey and Tulsa cores. Similar to its desktop processors, the Netburst processors suffered from excessive power consumption, which forced Intel to revise its processor architecture and strategy. The Netburst Xeons died with the dual-core Dempsey CPU with a clock speed of up to 3.73 GHz and 376 million transistors.
                <br><br>Today's Xeons are still based on the technology foundation that is also used for desktop and mobile processors, but Intel keeps them in a tight power envelope. The 2006 dual-core Woodcrest chip, a variant of the desktop Conroe chip, was the first representative of this new idea. The current Xeons are based on 32 nm Sandy Bridge and Sandy Bridge EP architecture, and Westmere processor designs. The CPUs have up to 10 cores and clock speeds up to 3.46 GHz, as well as up to 2.6 billion transistors.

While it follows the idea of the i860 and iAPX 432, it has found some powerful supporters and not been cut yet. The processor was launched as Intel's first 64-bit processor and was believed to be Intel's general idea for a 64-bit platform. However, the Itanium suffered in the 32-bit department and was heavily criticized for its lack of performance in this segment.
                <br><br>Itanium was launched with the 180 nm Merced core in 2001 as a mainframe processor with 733 MHz and 800 MHz clock speed and 320 million transistors – more than six times the count of a desktop Pentium at the time. The Itanium 2 followed in 2002 (180 nm McKinley core, as well as 130 nm Madison, Deerfield, Hondo, Fanwood and Madison cores) and wasn't updated until 2010 when Intel launched the Itanium 9000 with the 90 nm Montecito and Montvale cores, as well as the 65 nm Tukwila core with a massive 24 MB on-die cache, as well as more than 2 billion transistors. Despite persistent rumors that Intel will kill the Itanium at any time, there is a solid service ecosystem surrounding the processor.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Pentium M 700 series, launched with the 130 nm Banias core in 2003, was targeted at mobile computers but carried the philosophy of an Intel that did not focus its processors on clock speed anymore, but on power efficiency. The processor was developed by Intel's design team in Israel, which was led by Mooly Eden and David Perlmutter, who both hold key executive roles at Intel today.
                <br><br>Banias dropped its clock speed to 900 MHz to 1.7 GHz, down from 2.6 GHz of the Pentium 4 Mobile. However, the processor was rated at just 24.5 watts TDP, while the Pentium 4 chip was at 88 watts. The 90 nm shrink was called Dothan and dropped its thermal design power to 21 watts. Dothan had 140 million transistors and clock speeds of up to 2.13 GHz. The direct successor of Dothan was Yonah, which was released in 2006 as Core Duo and Core Solo, but was not related to the Intel Core micro-architecture. The Banias core and its impact on Intel is seen on the same level as the 4004, 8086 and 386 as the most significant milestones in the company's product history.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Pentium D was Intel's first dual-core processor. Still based on Netburst, the first version had the 90 nm Smithfield core (two Northwood cores) and was released as the Pentium D 800 series. It was succeeded by the 65 nm Presler (with two Cedar Mill cores) dual-core. Intel also released Extreme Editions of both processors and capped the maximum clock speed at 3.73 MHz and at a power consumption of 130 watts – the highest ever for any Intel consumer desktop processor (some server processors went up to 170 watts). Smithfield had 230 million transistors, Prescott 376 million.

            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Core 2 Duo was Intel's strike back against AMD's Athlon X2 and Opteron processors, which were highly successful at the time. The Core micro-architecture was launched with the 65 nm Conroe (Core 2 Duo E-6000 series) on the desktop, Merom on the mobile side (Core 2 Duo T7000 series), and Woodcrest in the server market (Xeon 5100 series). Intel quickly followed with quad-core versions (Kentsfield Core 2 Quad series for the desktop, Clovertown Xeon 5300 series for servers).
                <br><br>The Core micro-architecture was preceded by one of the most significant restructurings at Intel, as well as a substantial repositioning of the company. While Conroe was developed, Intel positioned its remaining Pentium and Pentium D processors to drive AMD into an unprecedented price war in 2005 and 2006, while the Core 2 Duo processor regained the performance lead over AMD in 2006. Conroe was launched with 1.2 GHz to 3 GHz clock speeds and as a chip with 291 million transistors. The CPUs were updated with a 45 nm Penryn shrink in 2008 (Yorkfield for quad-cores). While Intel always attempted to deliver a die shrink every two years, the arrival of Core 2 Duo also marked the introduction of the company's tick-tock cadence, which dictates a shrink in uneven years and a new architecture in even years.

The architecture was scaled to 32 nm (Westmere) in 2010 and provided the foundation for Intel processors covering the Celeron, Pentium Core and Xeon brands. Westmere scaled to up to eight cores, up to 3.33 GHz clock speed and up to 2.3 billion transistors.
                <br><br>Westmere was effectively replaced by the 32 nm Sandy Bridge architecture in 2011, which shrunk in 2012 to 22 nm in the Ivy Bridge generation (1.4 billion transistors for quad-core processors).
